The name given to the blog comes from a passage in the bible, that states:
> For now we see through a glass darkly
>
> &mdash; <cite>1 Corinthians 13:12</cite>

Surprisingly this appeared to me first in a movie(watched years ago), by the Swedish director [Ingmar Bergman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingmar_Bergman), called [Through a Glass Darkly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_a_Glass_Darkly_(film). The film is a masterpiece and a must see for any Cinephile(like myself).

But what really sticked with me was the underlying philosophical issue raised by it, that how we all construct a meaningful understanding of the world from the complexities of human experience. As the passage in corinthians says, that our ability to see the true essence of the world is obscured as if we were looking *through a glass, darkly*.

Seeing the reality clearly and unbiased it's almost like being omniscient(an unfiaseable thing to do, I'm afraid). We keep constatnly forgetting that our understanding is limited, our perspective is only a portion of the whole.

I think that probably resembles me of my "profession", having to deal with the uncertainty of things while being surrounded by people that seem so sure of their opinions.

Well that's probably it for now. I'll try to post every now and then some interesting(or not) stuff about technology or anythings else.
